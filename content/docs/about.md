# About Inkline
## Inkline is the intuitive UI Components library that gives you the foundation for building high quality, accessible, and customizable Vue.js Design Systems.

Inkline provides a great User Interface, User Experience, and Developer Experience, emphasizing a consistent and expressive API. It has been designed for creating flawless, unique experiences.

Inkline is officially maintained by [Alex Grozav](https://github.com/sponsors/alexgrozav) and the wonderful community members who are dedicated to building and supporting the system.

In October 2019, Inkline was awarded as a finalist for the <a href="https://osawards.com/vue/" rel="nofollow">Vue.js London 2019 Open Source Awards</a>, for the Developer Experience category.

### Getting started
The only prerequisite for using Inkline is having a basic understanding of Vue.js. If you are new to Vue.js, the best way to learn is reading through the [Official Vue.js Documentation](https://vuejs.org).

Finally, make sure to go through the [Documentation Homepage](/docs) and discover everything Inkline has to offer.

### Core Values
When developing Inkline, our top priority was to create a UI Library that delivers an exceptional User Experience (UX) through an intuitive and appealing User Interface (UI), and efficient Development Experience (DX).

##### User Interface (UI)
Using Inkline means you will get a great looking, reliable and flawless responsive website:

- **Design** - Components are be designed correctly and look objectively good. The design is minimal to offer a good base for customization.
- **Responsiveness** - Components look great on any screen size, ranging from phones and tablets to laptops and desktops.
- **Customization** - Components are customizable using color variants, design modifiers, and CSS Variables. All of Inkline's CSS Variables are inter-connected and propagate throughout the whole design system where applicable, providing you with a beautiful, consistent, and configurable design.

##### User Experience (UX)
A web application created with Inkline will be natural and intuitive to use. The User Experience is great, out of the box:

- **Functionality** - Components are working as expected. Custom form components have at least the same functionality as a native browser input.
- **Visual Feedback** - Components provide hover, focus, active, disabled and readonly states whenever needed.
- **Micro-interactions** - Components provide the right visual feedback with micro-interactions wherever possible. Animations are non-intrusive and appropriate.
- **Accessibility** - Components are accessible and provide the correct aria-properties for their respective states. Components are usable when navigating with a keyboard as well.

##### Developer Experience (DX)
Last but not least, Inkline code should be a pleasure to write. This is something that most UI Libraries overlook, but it is as important as UI and UX.

- **Code Design** - Code is well written, using Composition API. It uses the best practices and provides integrations with existing tools. The code is linted and follows a good style guide. It also promotes code reuse.
- **Documentation** - Great and easy to follow documentation with lots of examples. We know you love copy-pasting.
- **Consistency** - Components are natural and intuitive to use. Components have consistent property names and class names.
- **Performance** - Webpack introduced the concept of Tree shaking, where any code that remains unused will not be included in the final release bundle. Inkline fully takes advantage of it.
- **Testing** - The UI Library is well tested. Inkline proudly features Unit tests and integration tests with close to 100% code coverage.
- **Completely Typed** - Inkline is written entirely in TypeScript and provides first-class TypeScript support.
